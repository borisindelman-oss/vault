# 2026-01-03 LessWrong definition (Notion)

- Source: Notion page “Shadow Gym”.
- LessWrong score: % of frames where new model is less wrong than old model; suite score = average across tests.
- Baseline: model identical to old model ≈ 50% due to numerical noise.
- 100% means consistently less wrong on historical interventions; not a pass/fail—video review needed.
- Tests selected based on model prediction being wrong; eval uses model outputs (1s waypoint) not controller outputs.
