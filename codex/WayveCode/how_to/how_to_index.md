# WayveCode How-To Index

Think of this as a living book: short, practical chapters that explain **how our projects actually work**--the moving parts, the real tradeoffs, and the gotchas we only learn by shipping.

## Table of Contents
1. [How to teach parking models the difference between PARK and PUDO (stopping_mode)](how_to_parking-stopping-mode-dilc.md)
2. [How to align parking maneuver sampling with real-world behavior (Zak classifiers)](how_to_parking-maneuver-filters.md)
3. [How to trigger parking at end-of-route without retraining (wrapper route-end)](how_to_route-end-parking-trigger.md)
4. [How to build an end-to-end inference visualization tool (new vis tool)](how_to_inference-visualization-tool.md)

## How to Use This Book
- Each chapter is a standalone `how_to_[topic].md` file.
- Chapters focus on **plain language** explanations, the **actual code paths**, and **lessons learned**.
- When you add a new project write-up, link it here and keep the ordering intentional (like chapters).
