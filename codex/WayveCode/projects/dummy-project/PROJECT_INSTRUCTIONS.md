# Dummy Project - Project Instructions

## Overview
A sample project to demonstrate the vault-based project workflow.

## Build Rules
1. **Check project docs first** - Review `STATUS.md` and `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` before starting work.
2. **Follow the feedback loop** - Discuss → Build → Deploy → Check → Troubleshoot.
3. **Update status at session end** - Record progress, blockers, and next priorities in `STATUS.md`.
4. **Test before marking complete** - Verify functionality works before closing tasks.
