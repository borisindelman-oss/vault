# Route Map Signal Thresholds — Newsletter How-To

## Summary
Added a new newsletter-style how-to explaining route map span, map_scale_m, and how the route signal sum (e.g. 5e4) maps to pixel counts and physical distance. Also updated the how-to index.

## Files
- `newsletters/newsletter_route-map-signal-thresholds.md`
- `newsletters/newsletter_index.md`

## Highlights
- Clarified that map span is `2 * map_scale_m` meters.
- Explained how `route_signal` is computed (sum of red+green channels) and what `5e4` means in pixel terms.
- Added a concrete example for a full-height 1‑px route line.
