## Change made
Updated Section 5 Mermaid state machine to remove `interleaved_id`/`interleaved_event` emission semantics and show log-based switching + output emission.

Also aligned surrounding text:
- Section 4 branch-swap bullet now says "log the switch".
- Fixed Section 6 heading typo to `interleave_control`.
